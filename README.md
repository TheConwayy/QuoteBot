QuoteBot
========
The official repo for the Discord bot "Quote Bot"

## How it started

Since I am starting to learn Python, I figured I may as well dab around in discord.py, and with a combo of my previous knowledge and some help from the internet, this was made!
I know it's simple, but sometimes you just need to get a nice quote to get you through the day and this bot will provide you with just that!

## Discord

You can find the Discord [here](https://conwaysolutions.net/quotebot/discord/)

## Commands

- `"help` : Gives you the commands available!
- `"daily` : Sends the QoTD (Quote of The Day)!
- `"random` : Send a random quote!
- `"api` : Shows information about the API used to power the bot!

## Plans for the future

If this bot gets any up-votes (on [this](https://top.gg/bot/903688503257337928/) website) and some feedback from the community saying that they want more, well, I'll give you more!!
I also plan on adding some more here and there.. But, I would love to hear from you all!
*I also look foward to seeing what people create now that the bot is open source!*
