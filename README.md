QuoteBot
========
The official repo for the Discord bot "Quote Bot"

## How it started

Since I am starting to learn Python, I figured I may as well dab around in discord.py, and with a combo of my previous knowledge and some help from the internet, this was made!
I know it's simple, but sometimes you just need to get a nice quote to get you through the day and this bot will provide you with just that!

## What it is

This is a Discord bot that will send a quote, and depending on the command executed, the bot will give you a random or "daily" quote.

## Commands

- `"help` : Gives you the commands available!
- `"daily` : Sends the QoTD (Quote of The Day)!
- `"random` : Send a random quote!
- `"api` : Shows information about the API used to power the bot!
