THIS PROJECT IS ARCHIVED
========================

This project has been archived, and is no longer maintained nor hosted. 

There are a few reasons for this, the main being that I do not have as much time on my hands and I feel that I should exapnd beyond a project such as this one. 

However, I will say, this was a great introduction to APIs and how they work.

QuoteBot
========
The official repo for the Discord bot "Quote Bot"

## How it started

Since I am starting to learn Python, I figured I may as well dab around in discord.py, and with a combo of my previous knowledge and some help from the internet, this was made!
I know it's simple, but sometimes you just need to get a nice quote to get you through the day and this bot will provide you with just that!

## What it is

This is a Discord bot that will send a quote, and depending on the command executed, the bot will give you a random or "daily" quote.

## Plans for the Future

In the future I plan on updating this to [disnake](https://github.com/DisnakeDev/disnake) *(which I am working on now)* and then creating some more commands

I'm also going to host this on my end and then have this be a public bot

Other than that, I do not plan on doing too much.. If this blasts off I will make sure that this is updated and add features here and there.

## Commands

- `"help` : Gives you the commands available!
- `"daily` : Sends the QoTD (Quote of The Day)!
- `"random` : Send a random quote!
- `"api` : Shows information about the API used to power the bot!
